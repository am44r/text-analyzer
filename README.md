# text-analyzer
A short program that analyzes a piece of text    
  - Number of sentences    
  - Number of words   
  - Number of characters      
  - Occurence of a certain word    
 
I created this program to practice list comprehension and for loops.    
I also learned how to work with files in Python.    

Language used: Python
